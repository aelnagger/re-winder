# re-winder
A simple machine for winding filament on a spool. Meant for those occasions where your drill isn't doing the job right.

## Features
A simple stepper-driven solution for winding filament onto a spool. The machine should spool the filament nicely in a single layer, so you don't get the mountain from too much filament piling up in the center.

## Hardware
This machine uses two stepper motors. One to turn the spool being wound, and another to drive the filament guide.
